## **Support**

In this project, I utilized peer support in the creating and organizing various files in the code. Specifically, the api routes in the src folder. My peer helped me organize code and resolve previous errors that prevented the server from running and becomming live.

Additionally I used learning assistant generating code and error handling in the auth.ts in the middelware section, updating the Nabar.tsx, and the user-seeds.js file.
